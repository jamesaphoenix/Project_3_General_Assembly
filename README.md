# Project 3 - Regression and classification with housing data General Assembly Assignment

- - - - 

During this project, I learned how to implement machine learning models within Sci-kit learn and produced a regression and classification model using the Ames Housing Dataset.

* Analyzing  a complex dataset & explicitly state your assumptions.
* Cleaning, imputing, and exploring the dataset.
* Justifying my modeling choices and performing feature engineering.
* Plotting, visualizing, and logically interpreting the data.
* Clearly outlining my modeling strategy in response to the questions.
* Explaining my results to a technical audience.
